- 👋 Hi, I’m Phuong Huynh
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, mathematics, and solving problems.
- 🌱 I process a bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics, Satistics Concentration and minoring in Computer Science @ San Jose State University. 
- 💞️ After spending some time finding my own interests and myself, I realized how much I enjoy solving problems and understanding the algorithm in everything I do, not only in academic matters but also in daily life. I have been working on projects and finding ways to improve my technical skills.

- 🌱 Looking forward to learning and involving great sources for my educational journey!
